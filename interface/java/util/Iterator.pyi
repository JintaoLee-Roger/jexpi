class Iterator:
    """
    An iterator over a collection. Iterator takes the place of Enumeration in the Java Collections Framework. Iterators differ from enumerations in two ways:
    - Iterators allow the caller to remove elements from the underlying collection during the iteration with well-defined semantics.
    - Method names have been improved.
